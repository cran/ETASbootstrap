\title{Simulate a catalog of background earthquakes}
\usage{
simulate_background_earthquakes(earthquake_data_plus)
}
\arguments{
\item{earthquake_data_plus}{A object of data.frame with 7 columns: date, time,
longitude, latitude, magnitude, bandwidth, and probability, in this order and
in a consistent format for the first 5 columns.
The columns bandwidth and probability are two numeric vectors.
Column bandwidth records the smoothness
bandwidths used in variable kernel estimation and column probability contains
the probability for each earthquake in the catalog of interest (observed earthquakes)
to be a background event; see the etas function in the ETAS package (Jalilian and Zhuang, 2021) and
the articles of Zhuang et al. (2002, 2004).}
}
\value{
background_catalog: An object of data.frame with 5 columns: date,
  time, longitude, latitude, and magnitude of the simulated background earthquakes,
  in this order and a consistent format.
}
\description{
In fitting the ETAS model to the earthquake data catalog of
  interest (\bold{earthquake_data}), the background intensity function \eqn{{\mu}}
  is estimated. This function performs a simulation
  of background events based on the estimated \eqn{\hat{{\mu}}}.
  The time period for the simulated background catalog is consistent with
  that of \bold{earthquake_data}.
